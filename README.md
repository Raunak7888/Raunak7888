# 💫 About Me:
Hey, I’m Raunak. I like building backend stuff and figuring out how things work under the hood.
I enjoy solving problems, debugging tricky issues, and making things run smoother.
Most of the time, you'll find me messing with code, watching anime, or playing games.

Working on: making backend systems more clean and scalable
Open to: building cool projects with people who actually care
Learning: how big systems handle traffic, caching, and failovers
Ask me about: building APIs, system logic, or why something is slow
Fun fact: I end up analyzing anime fight logic like it's system architecture
